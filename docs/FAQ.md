1. What is this program's purpose?
2. Can I personally use this program?

1: This program was made for both practice and for a practical purpose. As im preparing to start renting, I was starting to think
how annoying it would be to have to constantly calculate how much each person would have to pay in terms of rent and utilities. So,
lazyness ultimately led me to make this program. Since it was made personally for me, modularity isn't really here. Rent and utilities
are only divided between 4 people, where ideally I want to make it any number of people (up to cap).

2: If you wish to use this program for your own personal use, please, be my guest. However, if you want to incorporate *any* changes to the source code,
please contact me at emanueljose11@hotmail.com .
